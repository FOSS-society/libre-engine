Description: a game engine written for linux that
can be used to create a variety of games including
2D Platforms to 3D Shooters.



Language: C++

Libraries:

	#Graphics/Window Management
	GLEW
	SDL2
	SDL2_image

	#InputHandling
	SDL2

	#Audio
	OpenAL

	#NET
	@@Proposed Idea:
	SDL2_NET



Architecture: Entity/Component/System

Also: Ability to create Client/Server connections .


	We create base objects that can be interited
into Components. Then we use Entities to hold a vector
of Components (called a ComponentList, or ComponentManager).
While the game is running Systems will be interacting
with active Entities, and their Components.


Systems:
	Audio
	Renderer
	SceneManager
	Physics
	Input


Classes:

core::LEVariant - Class that can represent any type
core::Entity - Class that represents an object in the engine
core::Component - Class that represents data an object contains
core::Sprite - Class that represents a 2D-image as a Component
core::Model - Class that represents a 3D-Object as a Component

math::Vector2 - Templated Class that represents an X and a Y variable
math::Vector3 - Templated Class that represents an X , Y and a Z variable
math::Vector4 - Templated Class that represents an X , Y , Z and a W  variable
math::Matrix2 - Templated Class that represents an 2 by 2 Matrix
math::Matrix3 - Templated Class that represents an 3 by 3 Matrix

physics::rectangle - Class that represents a rectangle collider
physics::circle - Class that represents a circle collider
physics::lineSegment - Class that represents a Line Segment
physics::line - Class that represents a Line that has one point and extends infinitely

graphics::Screen - Class that represents the Screen
graphics::BaseRenderer - Class that represents the Renderer on the screen
graphics::Renderer2D - Class that represents a 2D-Renderer, takes from BaseRenderer
graphics::Renderer3D - Class that represents a 3D-Renderer, takes from BaseRenderer
graphics::Image - Class that wraps SDL_image and holds image data

audio::Sound - Class that represents a Sound File
audio::SoundBuffer - Class that represents a buffer to handle streaming Sound Files
audio::Mixer - Class that can play Sound Files
audio::SoundStream - Class that represents the stream of Sound files


script::ScriptEngine - Class that represents the Scripting engine
script::Script - Class that represents a single script which can be run within
								 a ScriptEngine
