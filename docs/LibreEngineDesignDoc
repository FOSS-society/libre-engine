Description: a game engine written for linux that
can be used to create a variety of games including
2D Platforms to 3D Shooters. 



Language: C++

Libraries:

Architecture: Entity/Component/System

Also: Ability to create Client/Server connections .


	We create base objects that can be interited
into Components. Then we use Entities to hold a vector
of Components (called a ComponentList, or ComponentManager). 
While the game is running Systems will be interacting 
with active Entities, and their Components.
