Description: a game engine written for linux that
can be used to create a variety of games including
2D Platforms to 3D Shooters.



Language: C++

Libraries:

	#Graphics/Window Management
	GLEW
	SDL2
	SDL2_image

	#InputHandling
	SDL2

	#Audio
	OpenAL

	#NET
	@@Proposed Idea:
	SDL2_NET

	#Scripting
	Lua5.2


Build-System: Cmake

Architecture: Entity/Component/System

Also: Ability to create Client/Server connections .


	We create base objects that can be interited
into Components. Then we use Entities to hold a vector
of Components (called a ComponentList, or ComponentManager).
While the game is running Systems will be interacting
with active Entities, and their Components.


Systems:
	Audio
	Renderer
	SceneManager
	Physics
	Input


Classes:
[] = not started
[c] = Completed basic functionality
[i] = Incomplete functionality
[e] = Extra functionality is needed
[E] = Extra functionality is completed

[c] core::LEVariant - Class that can represent any type
[i] core::Entity - Class that represents an object in the engine
[i] core::Component - Class that represents data an object contains
[] core::Sprite - Class that represents a 2D-image as a Component
[] core::Model - Class that represents a 3D-Object as a Component
[] core::SFX - Class that represents a Sound Effect as a component
[] core::Collider2D - Class that represents a 2 Dimensional Collider as a component
[] core::Collider3D - Class that represents a 3 Dimensional Collider as a component
[] core::Behavior - Class that represents a Script as a component
[ce] core::Engine - Class that represents the whole engine

[c] math::Vector2 - Templated Class that represents an X and a Y variable
[c] math::Vector3 - Templated Class that represents an X , Y and a Z variable

[] physics::Sphere - Class that represents a Sphere Collider (3D)
[] physics::lineSegment - Class that represents a Line Segment
[] physics::line - Class that represents a Line that has one point and extends infinitely
	Note: Use this for raycasting

[c] graphics::Screen - Class that represents the Screen
[c] graphics::Renderer - Class that represents a renderer that works on both 2D and 3D
[] graphics::Image - Class that wraps SDL_image and holds image data


[] audio::Sound - Class that represents a Sound File
[] audio::SoundBuffer - Class that represents a buffer to handle streaming Sound Files
[] audio::Mixer - Class that can play Sound Files
[] audio::SoundStream - Class that represents the stream of Sound files


[c] script::ScriptEngine - Class that represents the Scripting engine
[c] script::Script - Class that represents a single script which can be run within
a ScriptEngine

[] system::RenderingSystem - Class that represents the Rendering System
	 note: based on the rendering Context

[] system::PhysicsSystem - Class that represents the Physics System
[] system::ScriptingSystem - Class that represents the Scripting engine as a System
[] system::AudioSystem - Class that represents the Audio System

[] program::SinglePlayerApp - Class that represents an application based on the engine
	 that is single player, and only relies on the base components of the engine

[] program::Client - Class that represents a client, which is an application that
	relies on a connection to a server

[] program::Server - Class that represents a server, a game can be written to run on
	this server, as a multi-player game
