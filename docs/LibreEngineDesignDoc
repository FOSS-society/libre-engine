Description: a game engine written for linux that
can be used to create a variety of games including
2D Platforms to 3D Shooters.



Language: C++

Libraries:

	#Graphics/Window Management
	GLEW
	SDL2
	SDL2_image

	#InputHandling
	SDL2

	#Audio
	OpenAL

	#NET
	@@Proposed Idea:
	SDL2_NET


Build-System: Cmake

Architecture: Entity/Component/System

Also: Ability to create Client/Server connections .


	We create base objects that can be interited
into Components. Then we use Entities to hold a vector
of Components (called a ComponentList, or ComponentManager).
While the game is running Systems will be interacting
with active Entities, and their Components.


Systems:
	Audio
	Renderer
	SceneManager
	Physics
	Input


Classes:

core::LEVariant - Class that can represent any type
core::Entity - Class that represents an object in the engine
core::Component - Class that represents data an object contains
core::Sprite - Class that represents a 2D-image as a Component
core::Model - Class that represents a 3D-Object as a Component
core::SFX - Class that represents a Sound Effect as a component
core::Collider2D - Class that represents a 2 Dimensional Collider as a component
core::Collider3D - Class that represents a 3 Dimensional Collider as a component
core::Behavior - Class that represents a Script as a component


math::Vector2 - Templated Class that represents an X and a Y variable
math::Vector3 - Templated Class that represents an X , Y and a Z variable
math::Vector4 - Templated Class that represents an X , Y , Z and a W  variable
math::Matrix2 - Templated Class that represents an 2 by 2 Matrix
math::Matrix3 - Templated Class that represents an 3 by 3 Matrix
math::Matrix4 - Templated Class that represents an 4 by 4 Matrix

physics::aabb - Class that represents an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box
								AABB2D and AABB3D
physics::rectangle - Class that represents a rectangle collider (2D)
physics::circle - Class that represents a circle collider (2D)
physics::Box - Class that represents a Box Collider (3D)
physics::Sphere - Class that represents a Sphere Collider (3D)
physics::lineSegment - Class that represents a Line Segment
physics::line - Class that represents a Line that has one point and extends infinitely
								Note: Use this for raycasting

graphics::Screen - Class that represents the Screen
graphics::BaseRenderer - Class that represents the Renderer on the screen
graphics::Renderer2D - Class that represents a 2D-Renderer, takes from BaseRenderer
graphics::Renderer3D - Class that represents a 3D-Renderer, takes from BaseRenderer
graphics::Image - Class that wraps SDL_image and holds image data


audio::Sound - Class that represents a Sound File
audio::SoundBuffer - Class that represents a buffer to handle streaming Sound Files
audio::Mixer - Class that can play Sound Files
audio::SoundStream - Class that represents the stream of Sound files


script::ScriptEngine - Class that represents the Scripting engine
script::Script - Class that represents a single script which can be run within
								 a ScriptEngine

system::RenderingSystem - Class that represents the Rendering System
													note: based on the rendering Context

system::PhysicsSystem - Class that represents the Physics System
system::ScriptingSystem - Class that represents the Scripting engine as a System
system::AudioSystem - Class that represents the Audio System

program::SinglePlayerApp - Class that represents an application based on the engine
													 that is single player, and only relies on the base
													 components of the engine

program::Client - Class that represents a client, which is an application that
									relies on a connection to a server

program::Server - Class that represents a server, a game can be written to run on
									this server, as a multi-player game
